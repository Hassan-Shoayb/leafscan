This project aims to detect and classify tomato diseases using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 model. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the pre-trained InceptionV3 model's knowledge on a large dataset and fine-tune it for our specific task of tomato diseases detection. The trained model is deployed on a website using TensorFlow JavaScript, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions regarding the presence of diseases in tomatoes.
